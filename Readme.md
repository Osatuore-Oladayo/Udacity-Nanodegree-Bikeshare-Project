## Udacity's Nanodegree Bikeshare Data Analysis project with Python, Numpy and Pandas

## Project Overview
> This project is focused on the exploratory analyis of data using the bikeshare data. The bikeshare data consists of information gotten from three cities in the united states. Chicago, New York City and Washington. Useful and meaningful information that can help future operations in the bikeshar company is to be drawn out of the datasets provided. Information such as the most common start station, most common day of the week and so on are drawn out.

### How it works
>The program written to satisfy this project takes into consideration, users who want to view the data with certain filters. Hence, users can filter each city data by the month, day (columns in the datasets), both month and day  or none at all. 

>The following are the information a user can draw from the program based on filter preferences:
>- Most common month
>- Most common day
>- Most common hour
>- Most common start station
>- Most common end station
>- Most common combination of start and end stations
>- Total trip duration
>- Average trip duration
>- Types of users by number
>- Types of users by gender (if birth year in a city's dataset)
>- Most frequenct birth year of a  user (if birth year in a city's dataset)
>- Most recent birth year i.e the youngest user(if birth year in a city's dataset)
>- Earliest birth year, i.e the oldest user(if birth year in a city's dataset)

### Requirements
- **Language:** Python 3.6 or above
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, time

### Project Data
- **chicago.csv** - The chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.
- **new_york_city.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.
- **washington.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. 
##### Please Note Chicago data does not include information about 'Gender' and 'Birth Year'.
